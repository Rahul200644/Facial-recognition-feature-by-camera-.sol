# Facial Recognition Feature by Camera

## Project Description

The **Facial Recognition Feature by Camera** is a blockchain-based smart contract system that enables secure facial recognition authentication using decentralized technology. This project combines traditional facial recognition technology with blockchain's immutable and transparent nature to create a trustless authentication system.

The smart contract manages facial recognition data by storing hashed facial features on the blockchain, enabling secure user authentication through authorized camera devices. Users can register their facial biometric data, and authorized cameras can authenticate users by comparing captured facial features with stored blockchain data.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize digital identity verification by creating a decentralized, secure, and privacy-focused facial recognition system. We aim to eliminate single points of failure in traditional centralized biometric systems while ensuring user privacy through cryptographic hashing and giving users full control over their biometric data.

By leveraging blockchain technology, we envision a future where:
- Users own and control their biometric identity data
- Authentication systems are transparent and auditable
- Privacy is preserved through cryptographic techniques
- Trust is established through decentralization rather than centralized authorities

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the `Project.sol` contract to your preferred Ethereum-compatible network
2. Authorize camera devices using the `setCameraAuthorization` function
3. Users register their biometric data using `registerFacialData`
4. Cameras authenticate users through `authenticateUser`
5. Monitor events and manage the system through the provided functions

## Security Considerations

- Always use secure hash functions for facial feature extraction
- Implement proper access controls for camera authorization
- Regular security audits of the smart contract
- Consider implementing rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Ensure secure communication channels between cameras and blockchain
